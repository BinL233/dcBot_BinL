The course will cover most major diseases using a variety of organizational schema including: (1) diseases according to organ systems, (2) diseases according to developmental and age-related processes, and (3) diseases according to causal factors including behavioral (lifestyle), environmental, and genetic factors. The course content is organized to encourage promotion of a healthy lifestyle, prevention of disease and understanding the causes and management of acute and chronic illness.
